# NLP-Data_Wrangling--Feature_Engineering
 This repository contains essential Natural Language Processing (NLP) scripts and notebooks focused on core data wrangling and feature engineering tasks. It covers key preprocessing techniques foundational for text analysis and machine learning applications.
 ## Contents
 - Text normalization: lowercasing, removing HTML tags, URLs, digits, spell check, emojis, and chat slang words
 - Cleaning punctuation and special characters
 - Tokenization of text into words
 - Stopword removal to filter out common words
 - Stemming and Lemmatization for word normalization
 - Named Entity Recognition (NER) integration for entity extraction
 - Feature engineering techniques including Bag-of-Words (BoW), TF-IDF, and n-grams

## Libraries Used
 - numpy - Numerical operations
 - pandas - Data manipulation and management
 - re (regular expressions) – robust text cleaning and pattern matching
 - emoji – detection and handling of emojis
 - nltk - Tokenization, lemmatization, stopwords, stemming and NER tools
 - sklearn (scikit-learn) - Feature extraction (BoW, TF-IDF), model training and evaluation
 - matplotlib & seaborn - Visualization of results and data exploration
